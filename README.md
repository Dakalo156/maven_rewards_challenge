# Customer Segmantation
This is the analysis about Maven Rewards Challenge (Sept 2024).
The description of the challenge was: youâ€™ll play the role of a Sr. Marketing Analyst at Maven Cafe. You've just run a test by sending different combinations of promotional offers to existing rewards members. Now that the 30-day period for the test has concluded, your task is to identify key customer segments and develop a data-driven strategy for future promotional messaging & targeting.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis can be found of this link: https://mavenanalytics.io/challenges/maven-rewards-challenge/404c6060-60eb-400f-9bce-c3b9f97e9d5a

# Notebooks
This analysis is broken into 4 playbooks
* 00 - Is a simple exploratory analysis. Analysing data with minimal manipulations
* 01 - I used a principle of RFM (Recency, Frequency and Money) for segmenting customers using only the transactions they made
* 02 - I expanded RFM to include the offers the customers received, viewed and completed
* 03 - In 02 and 03 I only focussed on customers with full details. In this notebook 03, I focussed on the customers with missing details (this for me, represented the unknown class of customers)

# Clustering - Customers with Full Details
KMeans clustering was used to segment customers into three segments.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60f97342-276d-484e-9603-fec69973f93d)
* This step of PCA followed by clustering seems to indicate the best numbers of clusters much easier
* According to the above elbow method and silhouette score, a k = 3 is the best number of clusters

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d05f20f-44f4-474a-a260-3948354c4518)

**Customer Clusters:**

* Cluster 0: Last bought long time ago, have lowest purchase frequency and spend low amount of money (Lost or churned customers)
* Cluster 1: Last bought more recently, have highest purchase frequency  and spend the highest amount (Loyal Customers -  keep coming and buying)
* Clsuter 3: Last bought recently, have low purcharse frequency and spent lowest amount of money (At risk customer - we might loose them)

## Customer Segments
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/148e6820-0849-40c7-8976-4748253a8060)

**For cluster 0 (Lost or Churned Customers):**

* Considering higher viewing of the offers received: ***discount_faf***, ***discount_229***, ***bogo_f19*** and ***bogo_4d5*** are the best options to send to this group
* ***discount_0b1***, ***bogo_9b9*** and ***discount_290*** have the highest completion to viewing ratio and they are also completed without being viewed. These are the same offers which are less viewed. Therefore these offers can be applied to customers without the need to send them to customers
* At a cut-off of 50% of completed to received offers, only ***bogo_0b1*** will not make it since it has a lower % ratio. Recommendation: don't focus on this offer.
* To get more than 60% conversion from receiving to completion focus on this offers: ***discount_faf***, ***discount_229*** and ***bogo_f19*** however to get the highest conversion focus on ***discount_faf***
* **Overall Recommendation**: For a higher return focus on this three offers in this group - ***discount_faf***, ***discount_229*** and ***bogo_f19***

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d813b18-1aaa-432b-9a7e-4e776241fa71)

**For cluster 1 (Loyal Customers):**

* Considering higher viewing of the offers received: ***discount_faf***, ***discount_229***, ***bogo_f19*** and ***bogo_4d5*** are the best options to send to this group
* ***discount_0b1***, ***bogo_9b9*** and ***discount_290*** have the highest completion to viewing ratio and they are also completed without being viewed. These are the same offers which are less viewed. Therefore these offers can be applied to customers without the need to send them to customers
* At a cut-off of 80% of completed to received offers, only ***bogo_4d5*** will not make it since it has a lower than 80% ratio.
* To get more than 80% conversion from receiving to completion focus on other offers besides ***bogo_4d5*** and ***informational offers*** however to get the highest conversions focus on ***discount_faf*** and ***discount_229***
* **Overall Recommendation**: Since these are loyal customers, sending all these offers will bring return or higher conversion.

**For cluster 2 (At risk customers):**

* Considering higher viewing of the offers received: ***discount_faf***, ***discount_229***, ***bogo_f19***, ***bogo_4d5***, ***informational_5a8*** and ***bogo_ae2*** are the best options to send to this group
* ***discount_0b1***, ***bogo_9b9*** and ***discount_290*** have the highest completion to viewing ratio and no offers were completed without being viewed first. These are the same offers which are less viewed. Therefore these offers can be applied to customers without the need to send them to customers.
* All ratio for completed to received offers are below 50% however ***discount_faf*** and ***discount_229*** have highest % ratio.
* To get more than 40% conversion from receiving to completion focus on this offers: ***discount_faf*** and ***discount_229***
* **Overall Recommendation**: For a higher return focus on this two offers in this group - ***discount_faf*** and ***discount_229***. Since in this group, the return will be low, these offers in this group can be stopped or not sent.


## Conclusion

**Overall Offers:**

* In all clusters ***discount_faf*** and ***discount_229*** are the best two offers which will offer best outcomes. 
* In addition for higher viewing of the offers received ***bogo_f19***, ***bogo_4d5***. 
* Therefore the channels of sending offers should be all four: ***['web', 'email', 'mobile', 'social']***
* ***bogo_ob1*** has the highest dificulty and duration and lowest channels for sending offers. It's completion to receiving ratio is low however it's completion after viewing is high.
* Loyal customers will offer best return than other group of customers
